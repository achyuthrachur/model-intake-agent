Vendor Methodology - Horizon Credit Scorecard v3.2

1. Purpose and Scope
The Horizon Credit Scorecard supports unsecured retail origination decisions for prime and near-prime applicants.
The model estimates 12-month probability of default and supports risk-based pricing bands.

2. Development Data
Development data includes booked loans from January 2019 through December 2024.
Data sources include application attributes, bureau trades, servicing performance, and collections outcomes.
Data quality checks include duplicate detection, missingness thresholds, and outlier capping policies.

3. Model Design
Core methodology uses logistic regression with WoE transformations and monotonic binning.
Candidate variables are screened through univariate power, stability, and business logic review.
Final variables include debt-to-income, utilization, recent delinquencies, vintage, and inquiry behavior.

4. Calibration and Cutoffs
Raw score is calibrated to observed default rates by origination segment.
Cutoff policy defines approve/review/decline bands with governance-approved override thresholds.

5. Limitations
Performance weakens in thin-file populations and rapidly changing macro environments.
Compensating controls include overlay policy and enhanced post-book monitoring.
